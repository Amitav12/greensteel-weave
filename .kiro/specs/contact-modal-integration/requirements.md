# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature converts the "Contact Us" functionality from a separate page navigation to a modal popup that opens when users click the "Contact Us" button in the header. This improves user experience by allowing users to contact the company without leaving their current page.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to click "Contact Us" and see a popup form instead of being taken to a different page, so that I can quickly send a message without losing my current context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the "Contact Us" button in the desktop header THEN the system SHALL open a modal popup with the contact form
2. WHEN a user clicks the "Contact Us" button in the mobile menu THEN the system SHALL open a modal popup with the contact form AND close the mobile menu
3. WHEN the contact modal is open THEN the system SHALL display a form with name, email, phone number, and message fields
4. WHEN the contact modal is open THEN the system SHALL display Submit and Cancel buttons at the bottom
5. WHEN the contact modal is open THEN the system SHALL display a close button (X) in the top right corner

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want multiple ways to close the contact modal, so that I have flexibility in how I interact with the interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the close button (X) in the top right THEN the system SHALL close the modal
2. WHEN a user clicks the Cancel button THEN the system SHALL close the modal AND clear the form data
3. WHEN a user clicks outside the modal content area THEN the system SHALL close the modal
4. WHEN a user presses the Escape key THEN the system SHALL close the modal

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want the contact form to work the same way as before, so that I can still successfully send messages to the company.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user fills out the form and clicks Submit THEN the system SHALL process the form submission as before
2. WHEN form submission is successful THEN the system SHALL show a success message AND close the modal
3. WHEN form submission is in progress THEN the system SHALL show a loading state on the Submit button
4. WHEN the modal closes after successful submission THEN the system SHALL clear all form data

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want the existing Contact page to remain accessible, so that I can still access it directly if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates directly to /contact THEN the system SHALL display the existing contact page
2. WHEN the contact modal is implemented THEN the system SHALL NOT remove the existing contact page functionality
3. WHEN the contact modal is implemented THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing styling and branding
