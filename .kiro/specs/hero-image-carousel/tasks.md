# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Set up image assets and create carousel component structure




  - Save the three provided industrial images to the assets directory with appropriate names
  - Create the base ImageCarousel component file with TypeScript interfaces






  - Set up proper imports and exports for the new component
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 5.1_






- [ ] 2. Implement core carousel functionality and state management
  - Create React state hooks for current image index, play/pause state, and transition status



  - Implement automatic image progression timer with configurable interval

  - Add image preloading logic to ensure smooth transitions
  - Create cleanup functions to prevent memory leaks



  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 4.2, 5.4_


- [x] 3. Build carousel UI with smooth transitions


  - Implement fade transition animations between images using CSS transforms and opacity


  - Create responsive image container with proper aspect ratio handling
  - Add loading states and error handling for failed image loads


  - Ensure images are properly positioned and sized across all breakpoints

  - _Requirements: 1.3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 4.5_



- [ ] 4. Integrate carousel with existing HeroSimple component
  - Modify HeroSimple component to include the ImageCarousel as a background layer
  - Ensure proper z-index layering so existing content remains visible and interactive
  - Maintain all existing background overlays and glass morphism effects
  - Preserve existing animations, particles, and interactive elements
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 5.3_

- [ ] 5. Implement accessibility and performance optimizations
  - Add support for prefers-reduced-motion media query to pause animations
  - Implement proper ARIA labels and alt text for screen readers
  - Add keyboard navigation support and focus management
  - Optimize image loading with lazy loading and compression
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.3, 4.4, 5.2_



- [ ] 6. Add responsive behavior and mobile optimization
  - Ensure carousel works seamlessly across mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
  - Implement touch-friendly interactions and proper scaling
  - Test and adjust image positioning for different screen orientations
  - Maintain performance on mobile devices with optimized image sizes
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5_

- [ ] 7. Create comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms
  - Implement graceful degradation when images fail to load
  - Add error boundaries to prevent component crashes
  - Create fallback to existing hero background if carousel fails
  - Add loading indicators and skeleton states for better UX
  - _Requirements: 4.5, 5.5_

- [ ] 8. Write unit tests for carousel functionality
  - Test carousel state management and automatic progression
  - Test image loading, error handling, and fallback scenarios
  - Test accessibility features including reduced motion support
  - Test responsive behavior and performance across different conditions
  - _Requirements: 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 5.4_

- [ ] 9. Perform integration testing and visual validation
  - Test carousel integration with existing HeroSimple component functionality
  - Verify all existing animations, buttons, and interactive elements still work
  - Validate text readability and contrast with different background images
  - Test cross-browser compatibility and performance impact
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 2.4, 4.2, 5.3_

- [ ] 10. Final optimization and documentation
  - Optimize image assets for web delivery with appropriate compression
  - Add configuration options for easy customization of timing and effects
  - Document component props, usage examples, and customization options
  - Perform final performance audit and memory leak testing
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 5.1, 5.2_
